1. INTRODUCTION

The Fraunhofer Telegram Splitting - Ultra Narrowband Library ("TS-UNB-Lib") is software
that implements only the uplink of the ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard ("MIOTY") for wireless 
data transmission in the field of IoT. Patent licenses for any patent claim regarding the 
ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard implementation (including those of Fraunhofer) may be 
obtained through Sisvel International S.A. 
(https://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programs/wireless-communications/mioty/license-terms)
or through the respective patent owners individually. The purpose of this TS-UNB-Lib is 
academic and non-commercial use. Therefore, Fraunhofer does not offer any support for the 
TS-UNB-Lib. Furthermore, the TS-UNB-Lib is NOT identical and on the same quality level as 
the commercially-licensed MIOTY software also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged
to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications information and documentation.

/**
 * @brief Template class for the generation and transmission of simple TS-UNB uplink-only data
 *
 * This template class implements a simple uplink-only TS-UNB node. The class has to be initialized
 * using the init() method before the transmission. Furthermore, the parameters of the MAC and TX
 * class have to be configure properly, e.g. setting the EUI-64 address. For this purpose the MAC and
 * TX instances are public.
 *
 * The template parameter MAC defines a class for the MAC encoding. This class has to offer an int16_t init() method,
 * a uin16_t MPDU_Length(payloadLength) to get the length of the MPDU data as function of the payload length,
 * and a uin16_t encode(MPDU, payload, payloadLength) method for the encoding where the return value is the length of the MPDU.
 *
 * The template parameter PHY defines a class for the PHY encoding. This class has to offer a
 * uint16_t numRadioBursts(MPDU_length) method to return the number of radio bursts as function of the MPDU length.
 * In addition, it has to offer a uint32_t encode(RadioBurst_T* const RadioBursts, const uint8_t* const MPDU, const uint16_t MPDU_Length,
 * const uint8_t TSMAPattern) method for generating the data bursts. The return value is the frequency register setting of the
 * transmitter, or 0 in case of an error.
