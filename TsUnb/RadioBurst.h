1. INTRODUCTION

The Fraunhofer Telegram Splitting - Ultra Narrowband Library ("TS-UNB-Lib") is software
that implements only the uplink of the ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard ("MIOTY") for wireless 
data transmission in the field of IoT. Patent licenses for any patent claim regarding the 
ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard implementation (including those of Fraunhofer) may be 
obtained through Sisvel International S.A. 
(https://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programs/wireless-communications/mioty/license-terms)
or through the respective patent owners individually. The purpose of this TS-UNB-Lib is 
academic and non-commercial use. Therefore, Fraunhofer does not offer any support for the 
TS-UNB-Lib. Furthermore, the TS-UNB-Lib is NOT identical and on the same quality level as 
the commercially-licensed MIOTY software also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged

 * @brief	Implementation of Radio Bursts
 *
 * This template class implements radio burst for ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB.
 * Each radio burst is a short chunk of data with a well-defined time and frequency
 * position within each TS-UNB packet. Each burst contains 24 payload symbols and
 * a 12 symbol long mid-amble, which results in a total length of 36 symbols.
 * In order to align the data to bytes a head and tail bits can be added. Furthermore
 * the head bits are required for the potential transmitter ramp-up time and for the
 * MSK decoding based on a matched filter. Therefore, two head bits and two tail bits
 * are recommended.
 *
 * The template parameter HEAD_BITS defines the number of head bits (2 are recommended).
 *
 * The template parameter TAIL_BITS defines the number of tail bits (2 are recommended).
