/**
 * @brief Implementation of burst transmission using the HopeRF RFM69HW
 *
 * This class implements the transmission of the radio bursts using the HopeRF RFM69HW
 * transmitter module. For this purpose the transmitter is switched into the continuous
 * transmission mode and the symbol clock is generated by the microcontroller.
 * The RFM69HW DIO2 pin is not used for the modulation. Consequently, the frequency deviation
 * is set to zeros. Instead this implementation directly changes the transmission frequency
 * for the modulation of the data.
 *
 * Depending on the actual transmitter module the template parameter BOOST_PIN must be set to true.
 * However, some modules do only support one of the modes. For transmit powers >13dBm the BOOST_PIN
 * must be always set to true, which requires the module to support it.
 *
 * The template parameter F_DEV defines the frequency deviation. The RFM69HW has a minimum step size of
 * exactly 61.03515625Hz. The required frequency deviation for the standard mode is 2380.371Hz / 4 =
 * 595.09275Hz, which cannot be achieved 61.03515625Hz. This would require a frequency deviation of 9.75.
 * Though, a frequency deviation of 10 (610.3515625Hz) results has shown to work properly. For other modes
 * the frequency deviation may be adjusted.
 *
 * The template class RadioBurst_T defines a radio burst data structure. The actual implementation has to
 * offer the methods: uint16_t getBurstLength(void), uint8_t* getBurst(void), uint16_t get_channel(void).
 *
 * At an early stage in the program the init() method shall be called. It brings the device into the sleep
 * mode to save energy. It is not part of the constructor to allow the user to start a watchdog before
 * calling the init() method.
 * 
 * @tparam		Cpu_T			Plattform depended implementation
 * @tparam		BOOST_PIN		Use of the PA BOOST pin (depends on the hardware, default is off)
 * @tparam		F_DEV			Frequency deviation resgister setting
 * @tparam		RadioBurst_T	Radio burst class
